# Twitter/X Video Scraper and Downloader

This Python project automates the process of scraping video posts from Twitter/X and downloads the corresponding video and audio streams. The script then merges the video and audio files using `ffmpeg`.

## Features
- **Automated Twitter/X Login**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to log in and access the feed.
- **Scrolling and Scraping**: Automatically scrolls through a Twitter/X feed to find video posts.
- **Date Filtering**: Filters posts based on the provided date to capture only relevant posts.
- **Video and Audio Extraction**: Extracts video and audio stream URLs from network logs using browser performance logs.
- **Video and Audio Merging**: Downloads and merges the video and audio using `ffmpeg` without re-encoding.

## Twitter/X Blob Streaming Method
- Twitter/X uses blob URLs for streaming media content. These blob URLs point to media resources fetched over HTTP. The blob method allows the browser to handle the media streams dynamically. This project leverages these network requests to extract `.m3u8` video and audio streams, which are then downloaded and merged.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Chrome WebDriver
- Twitter/X account credentials
- `ffmpeg` (for video and audio merging)

### Python Libraries:
- `selenium`
- `pandas`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `json`
- `subprocess`
  
You can install the required libraries with the following command:
```bash
pip install selenium pandas beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- Download and install the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome version.
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

### 2. Update Credentials
- Open the script and replace the placeholders for your Twitter/X credentials in the `credentials` dictionary:
  ```python
  credentials = {
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```

### 3. Prepare the Input Data
- Create a CSV file named `urls.csv` with a column `url` that contains the Twitter/X URLs you wish to scrape.

### 4. Run the Script
- The script will automatically log in, scroll through the feed, and capture video and audio URLs based on the provided date.
- To start the scraping process, execute the script with:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```

### 5. Download and Merge Videos
- The script will download the video and audio streams and merge them into `.mp4` files in the current directory.
- You can modify the `input_date` in the script to filter posts after a specific date:
  ```python
  input_date = "2024-10-10"  # Specify the date to scrape posts from
  ```

### Example Command for Video/Audio Merging
If you want to manually run the ffmpeg command for merging:
```bash
ffmpeg -i video_url -i audio_url -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental output_file.mp4
```

## Notes
- Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to scrape content from Twitter/X.
- This script relies on browser automation, so the performance may vary depending on network speed and Twitter/X's interface updates.
