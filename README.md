Running the Project
Prepare the CSV File: Ensure you have a CSV file named urls.csv in the project directory. The file should contain a column named url with the URLs you want to scrape.

python main.py
Enter the input date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) when prompted.

Run the Download and Merge Script: After populating the URLs, run the following command to download and merge the videos and audio.

Ensure your urls.csv file is properly formatted and located in the project directory.
The output files from the merging process will be named final_output_1.mp4, final_output_2.mp4, etc.
